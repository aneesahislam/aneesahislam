## Hi there, I'm Aneesah ðŸ‘‹ 

<h1>
  I'm a software engineer specializing in full stack development.

<p>
Iâ€™ve always been fascinated by the complex systems that shape our world, whether itâ€™s the logic behind an elaborate computer application or the cultural frameworks that define society. This curiosity led me to pursue a bachelorâ€™s degree in Anthropology, where I explored cultural patterns across human history. Years later, while working at a library, I rediscovered that same curiosity through technology. As I helped patrons throughout the day with tech related questions, I pondered the logic behind many of the common applications we use everyday. One answer led to another question, and before long, I was immersed into the world of coding. The analytical mindset I once applied to my studies in Anthropology, guides me in programming. Today, Iâ€™m excited to contribute to meaningful projects.
