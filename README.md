For as long as I can remember, I’ve been fascinated by the complex systems that shape our world, whether it’s the logic behind an elaborate computer application or the cultural frameworks that define society. This curiosity led me to pursue a bachelor's degree in Anthropology, where I explored cultural patterns throughout human history. Years later, while working at a library, my love with coding was fostered. As I helped patrons throughout the day with tech related questions I pondered the logic behind many of the applications and websites we use everyday. Questions such as, “when I send an email, how is it rendered and received by the recipient,” and “when I type something into a search engine, how does the computer know what information to return” and so on would consume my mind. As I delved into coding, I found that each answer led to new questions. The same analytical lens that once helped me interpret cultural patterns in Anthropology now drives me to explore technology through coding. Today, I’m excited to contribute to meaningful projects.
