## Hi there, I'm Aneesah ðŸ‘‹ 
</p>

<p align="center">
  I'm a software engineer specializing in full stack development.
</p>

<p align="center">
For as long as I can remember, Iâ€™ve been fascinated by the complex systems that shape our world, whether itâ€™s the logic behind an elaborate computer application or the cultural frameworks that define society. This curiosity led me to pursue a degree in Anthropology, where I explored cultural patterns throughout human history. Years later, while working at a local library, my love for coding was fostered. As I helped patrons throughout the day with tech related questions I pondered the logic behind many of the applications and websites we use everyday. Today, that same fascination fuels my work as a full stack software developer. Solving difficult problems, understanding how things work under the hood, and building impactful solutions has always driven my work and I'm eager to contribute my knowledge and skills to a meaningful project.
